# Naming Conventions of JavaScript Variables
* uppercase and lowercase: possible
* numbers: can be anywhere except in the front
* underscore and dollar signs are okay
* Javascript variables are case-sensitive
# Let vs Const vs Var
* let-Can change value also new way
* const-Can't change value 
* var-Can change value but is old way
* Using var, you can redeclare a variable in javascript and it will update the value of the variable
* Using let, you can't redeclare a variable in javascript 
* In var variable, you can give the value to the variable after or before the declaration
* In let variable, you should give the value to the variable after the declaration
# Data-types in Javascript 
* number-Thing that store decimals and intergers
* undefined-Will show if you don't put any value into the variable
* null-Is a value but kind of not 
* bigint-Can store more numbers than the number data-type, also if you want it to show then put n and the end
* string-Stores words and lines but you have to put them in quotations," " or ' '
* boolean-True or false 
# Assignment Operators
* all assignment operators expressions execute from right to left    ++ is a unary operator
* binary operator =,+,/,-, are binary operators because they need two operands to execute
* unary operator=is inplemented on a single operator
* operand=numbers, string, and variables which are surronding the operator
* assignment operators:=, +=, -=, *=, /=
* if dividend < diviser then %(moduele) operator will give dividend will appear
# Arithematic Operators
* Arithematic operators=**, -, +, *, /, %
* you can declace multiply variables inside one line
